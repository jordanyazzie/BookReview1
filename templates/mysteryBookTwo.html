  <h2>The Library of Lost and Found <br> by Phaedra Patrick (Goodreads Author) </h2>

  <p><span class="font-weight-bold">A librarian's discovery of a mysterious book sparks the journey of a lifetime in the delightful new novel from the
    international bestselling author of The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper</span> Librarian Martha Storm has always found it easier to connect with books
    than people--though not for lack of trying. She keeps careful lists of how to help others in her superhero-themed notebook. And yet, sometimes it feels
    like she's invisible.All of that changes when a book of fairy tales arrives on her doorstep. Inside, Martha finds a dedication written to her by her
    best friend--her grandmother Zelda--who died under mysterious circumstances years earlier. When Martha discovers a clue within the book that her
    grandmother may still be alive, she becomes determined to discover the truth. As she delves deeper into Zelda's past, she unwittingly reveals a
    family secret that will change her life forever.Filled with Phaedra Patrick's signature charm and vivid characters, The Library of Lost and Found
    is a heartwarming and poignant tale of how one woman must take control of her destiny to write her own happy ending.</p>
