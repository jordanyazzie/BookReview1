  <p>Poetry is a form of literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities in addition
    to, or in lieu of, its apparent meaning. Poetry may be written independently, as discrete poems, or may occur in
    conjunction with other arts, as in poetic drama, hymns or lyrics.</p>
  <p>Poetry often uses particular forms and conventions to expand the literal meaning of the words, or to evoke
    emotional or sensual responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes
    used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poetry's use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic
    elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor and simile
    create a resonance between otherwise disparate imagesâ€”a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not
    perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.</p>
